#There are 3 collections in Galaxy for INM Power systems. 
#I used playbooks for HMCs, VIOS and AIX. 
#There are a bunch of these available, stuff I don't know about (Zseries, ya they are still alive!)
#Get them here :
#AIX : ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.power_aix
#VIOS: ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.power_vios
#HMC: ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.power_hmc
